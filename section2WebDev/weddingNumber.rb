# How about weddingNumber? It should work almost the same as englishNumber, except 
# that it should insert the word "and" all over the place, returning things like 
# 'nineteen hundred and seventy and two', or however wedding invitations are 
# supposed to look. I'd give you more examples, but I don't fully understand 
# it myself. You might need to contact a wedding coordinator to help you.
## TODO add the "and"s

    #  Now here's a really sly trick:
    hundreds  = englishNumber write
    numString = numString + hundreds + ' hundred'
     #  That's called "recursion".  So what did I just do?
    #  I told this method to call itself, but with "write" instead of
    #  "number".  Remember that "write" is (at the moment) the number of
    #  hundreds we have to write out.  After we add "hundreds" to "numString",
    #  we add the string ' hundred' after it.  So, for example, if
    #  we originally called englishNumber with 1999 (so "number" = 1999),
    #  then at this point "write" would be 19, and "left" would be 99.
    #  The laziest thing to do at this point is to have englishNumber
    #  write out the 'nineteen' for us, then we write out ' hundred',
    #  and then the rest of englishNumber writes out 'ninety-nine'.
    
    if left > 0
      #  So we don't write 'two hundredfifty-one'...
      numString = numString + ' '

  write = left/10          #  How many tens left to write out?
  left  = left - write*10  #  Subtract off those tens.
  
  if write > 0
    if ((write == 1) and (left > 0))
      #  Since we can't write "tenty-two" instead of "twelve",
      #  we have to make a special exception for these.
      numString = numString + teenagers[left-1]
      #  The "-1" is because teenagers[3] is 'fourteen', not 'thirteen'.
      
      #  Since we took care of the digit in the ones place already,
      #  we have nothing left to write.
      left = 0
    else
      numString = numString + tensPlace[write-1]
      #  The "-1" is because tensPlace[3] is 'forty', not 'thirty'.
