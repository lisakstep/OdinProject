 # Make an OrangeTree class. It should have a  height method which returns its height, and a  oneYearPasses 
 # method, which, when called, ages the tree one year. Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think 
 # an orange tree should grow in a year), and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should 
 # die. For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that 
 # older trees produce more each year than younger trees... whatever you think makes most sense. And, of course, 
 # you should be able to countTheOranges (which returns the number of oranges on the tree), and pickAnOrange 
 # (which reduces the @orangeCount by one and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else 
 # it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year). Make sure that any oranges you don't pick 
 # one year fall off before the next year.
