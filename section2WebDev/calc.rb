hours_in_a_day = 24

seconds_in_a_minute = 60

# how many hours are in a year?
hours_in_a_year = 365 * 24
puts "There are #{hours_in_a_year} hours in a normal year and #{hours_in_a_year + 24} in a leap year."

# how many minutes are in a decade?
minutes_in_a_decade = years_in_a_decade * days_in_a_year * hours_in_a_day * minutes_in_an_hour
puts "There are #{minutes_in_a_decade} minutes in a decade."

# how many seconds old am I?
my_age_in_days = (51 * days_in_a_year) + 11*30 + 4
my_age_in_hours = my_age_in_days * hours_in_a_day

my_age_in_seconds = my_age_in_minutes * seconds_in_a_minute
puts "I am approximately #{my_age_in_seconds} seconds old."
